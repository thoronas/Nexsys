	<h1>Frequently asked <br><strong>questions</strong></h1>
	<section class="floatClear">
		<section class="twoColumn">
			<h4>Does NEXSYS Financial fund or sell mortgages?</h4>
			<p>NEXSYS does not sell mortgages. We simply assist Agents and represent a mortgage application to a Lender on behalf of the originating Agent until the deal is funded. After funding, deals are co-brokered back to Agents through Filogix, as these deals belong to the originating Agent.</p>
			<h4>Does NEXSYS slow down the closing process? </h4>
			<p>Time spent on submitting through NEXSYS is comparable to submitting direct. The only difference is that you input your notes on the system instead of Filogix. The relationships we've built with core-Lenders allow us to often obtain commitments faster. You save time on the administrative tasks allowing you to focus more time on your actual client.</p>
			<h4>How much does this service cost?</h4>
			<p>We have a simple $50.00 per Agent per annum fee. Individual transaction costs depend on transaction quality and annual volume. <a href="#">Details 	&raquo;</a></p>
			<h4>Can NEXSYS send deals to any Lender? </h4>
			<p>Yes, NEXSYS can send deals to most lenders in Canada; however there is a 20bps charge for deals sent to lenders who do not have a relationship with us.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="twoColumn-right">
			<h4>Can I sign up online without my Brokerage approval? </h4>
			<p>No, the Brokerage registeres first, then signs up the Agents.</p>
			<h4>Who owns the client?</h4>
			<p>The client always belongs to the originating Broker.</p>
			<h4>How do I get paid?</h4>
			<p>The Lender pays NEXSYS and NEXSYS in turn pays the Brokerage.</p>
			<h4>Can I speak to a live representative about this program?</h4>
			<p>Yes, call 877-901-4997 x206 to speak to our Business Development Manager or email us at <a href="#">sales@nexsysfinancial.com.</a></p>

	<h1>Common<br><strong>Objections</strong></h1>
	<section class="floatClear">
		<article class="margin20px"><h2 class="objection">I get top-tier volume bonuses with most Lenders. I don't want to give that up.</h2><span class="arrow"></span><p class="response">NEXSYS also gives Brokerages the opportunity to earn volume bonus. As the number of funded deals increase, your volume bonus increases. With Scotia, you are automatically entitled to 10bps volume bonus.</p></article>
		<article class="margin20px"><h2 class="objection">With [lender], I currently get Xbps. Do I have to start from scratch with NEXSYS?</h2><span class="arrow"></span><p class="response">You may choose to submit directly to Lenders currently offering you top-tier volume bonuses while submitting all other deals through the NEXSYS system.</p></article>
		<article class="margin20px"><h2 class="objection">I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to this. Is there a trial period?</h2><span class="arrow"></span><p class="response">No, there is a due-diligence process each application must follow, so your Brokerage must register before you can submit deals to NEXSYS. For fee information, please speak with a BDM. <a href="#">Details 	&raquo;</a></p></article>
		<article class="margin20px"><h2 class="objection">Why would an Agent use a service for underwriting when a $75 submission fee is charged, even if the deal is declined?</h2><span class="arrow"></span><p class="response">The $75 submission fee is waived if the deal closes. This fee ensures our staff focus their efforts on real deals. To limit your exposure to this fee, we encouraged you to  discuss "grey" deals with our customer service agent prior to submission.</p></article>
		<article class="margin20px"><h2 class="objection">Our Brokerage won't get the volume recognition from Lenders.</h2><span class="arrow"></span><p class="response">Although the volume is credited to NEXSYS, every effort  is made to inform the Lender about who the originating Agent/Broker is. All Agents/Brokers are asked to input their own individual and Brokerage details on the Disclosure to Borrower.</p></article>
		<article class="margin20px"><h2 class="objection">I submit most of my deals to other lenders. Fees are too high with NEXSYS.</h2><span class="arrow"></span><p class="response">Currently there is a surcharge of 20bps for deals submitted to lenders who do not have an underwriting relationship with NEXSYS.  If we see enough volume with these lenders, we may consider adding them to our core-Lender list and eliminate the 20bps surcharge. We could also find a Lender on our list who offers comparable rates/products/rates.</p></article>
		<article class="margin20px"><h2 class="objection">This adds a time-consuming step to my submission process.</h2><span class="arrow"></span><p class="response">Time spent on submitting through NEXSYS is comparable to submitting direct. The only difference is that you input your notes on the NEXSYS system instead of Filogix. The relationship NEXSYS has built with core-Lenders often allows us to obtain commitments faster.  Also, you save time on the administrative tasks allowing you to focus more time on the actual client.</p></article>
